		<h3>Alan Turing</h3>

		<p id="title">Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
		
		<h3>Early Life</h3>

		<p>Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London, to Julius Mathison Turing OBE FRS and Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney). His father was a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. His mother was a devout Christian. Turing had one younger brother, John (1914–1997). Turing was educated at St Michael's Church of England Primary School, in West Dulwich, and then at Sherborne School, a public school in Dorset, where he was a scholar. He was then educated at King's College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Apostles, a secret society. He was awarded a First in Mathematics in 1934, and a First in Mathematical Tripos in 1935. He was elected a Fellow of King's College in 1935, and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936.</p>

			<li>He was a pioneer of computer science, and is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</li>
			<li>He was a leading figure in mathematical logic, and was one of the first to recognise the importance of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, the problem of deciding whether a given statement is true or false within the formal system of any given formal language. This is now known as the Turing–Church thesis, after Alonzo Church.</li>
